This repository contains all that is needed to fully generate the [Knowledge Base](https://www.wisecashhq.com/help/what-is-wisecash) of my cash-flow forecasting SaaS app [WiseCash](https://www.wisecashhq.com).

## Using this as a template for your own Knowledge Base

You can freely reuse this repository as a starting point to create your own Knowledge Base. Just make sure to tweak the appearance enough that it doesn't look too similar, and do not reuse written content, images or animations. [Contact us](mailto:support@wisecashhq.com) in case of doubt.

## How to run locally

* Clone this repository to your machine.
* Make sure to have Ruby installed (tested fine on Ruby 2.1.x).
* Install required dependencies with `bundle install`
* Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Go to [http://localhost:4000/help/](http://localhost:4000/help/)

## How to build in production

This is mostly:

```
cd wisecash-support-clone
bundle exec jekyll build --destination $target_folder -c _config.yml,_private_config.yml
```

Private config is used to avoid leaving it in the public repository. It is empty at the moment (but used to contain typekit id, back when it was used).
