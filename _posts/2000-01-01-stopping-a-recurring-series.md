title: Stopping A Recurring Series
section: Working with Transactions

When a [recurring series, Setting up a Recurring Transaction] is in place, you may want to stop it.

If this is only temporary, you can **set the amount to zero** and save all upcoming occurrences.

If you want to stop the series for good, though, follow the steps below:

## Go to the Account Overview page

While it can be done from other screens in WiseCash, stopping a recurring series from the [Account Overview] page makes it easier to verify what you are doing:

{% include screenshot.html file="reaching-account-overview.png" %}

## Select the first occurrence to be deleted

In the transactions list, click the **edit** {% icon fa-pencil %} icon on the **first occurrence** that you want to delete:

{% include screenshot.html file="selecting-a-transaction.png" %}

Once selected it should appear in blue:

{% include screenshot.html file="selected-transaction.png" %}

## Click on Delete with future occurrences

Hover the **Delete with future occurrences** button to get a preview of which transactions will be deleted. They will appear in red:

{% include screenshot.html file="preview-deletion-of-transactions.png" %}

If you're happy with the preview, click on **Delete with future occurrences** to validate:

{% include screenshot.html file="delete-upcoming-transactions.png" %}
