When a [recurring series, Setting up a Recurring Transaction] is already in place, you can modify one entry, if needed. Here is how to do that:

## Go to the [Account Overview] page

While it can be done from other screens in WiseCash, editing the data from the [Account Overview] page makes it easier to verify what you are doing.

## Select the Transaction To Be Modified

Click on the **edit icon**. The selected transaction should appear in blue and its data should be displayed in the entry form:

## Modify the Occurrence Information

Change the required data then click on Save:

<div class='alert alert-info' role='alert'>
  <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> Changing the due date will "detach" the occurrence from its series. This means that future updates to the series as a whole won't impact this occurrence anymore.
</div>
