Every Sunday morning, WiseCash sends you the overdue and 2-week upcoming transactions in an email. This email contains the exact same list provided by the [dashboard,Overdue & Upcoming Transactions Tracking]. It looks like this:

{% include full-screenshot.html file="weekly-reminder-email.png" %}

This email helps you stay on top of your finances when you are going offline for a couple of days, yet want to avoid missing any deadline.

If for some reason you want to turn that reminder off, go to your settings ({% icon fa-cog %} icon):

{% include screenshot.html file="disable-weekly-reminder.png" %}
