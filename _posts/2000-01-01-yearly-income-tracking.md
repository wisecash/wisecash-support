The yearly income tracker displays a running total of all your income transactions, starting from the day you defined as the beginning of your fiscal year, including both paid and not yet paid income transactions:

It also compares this running total to the yearly income goal you define.

Here is how to configure and get results for your business:

## Define your start of fiscal year

Go to your settings ({% icon fa-cog %} icon) then change the start of fiscal year:

{% include screenshot.html file="settings-fiscal-year.png" %}

<div class='alert alert-info' role='alert'>
  <i class="fa fa-warning"></i> If you are just getting started with WiseCash, you can either set the start of fiscal year to the current month, or create and mark as paid one big income transaction to simulate the income you've already made before starting to use WiseCash.
</div>

## Go to the Yearly Goal chart

Click on the **forecasting** {% icon fa-signal %} icon then on **Yearly Goal**:

</div>
