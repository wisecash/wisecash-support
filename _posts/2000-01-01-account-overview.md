title: Account Overview
section: Forecasting Your Cash-Flow
index: 3

The account overview shows you all the overdue and upcoming transactions for a given account (client, institution, provider...).

This is a very useful screen to keep your cash-flow data updated, since it gives you a focused view and makes it easier to verify your data. Here is how to reach that screen:

## Go to the Account Overview screen

To do that you can either click on a given transaction account's name like this:

{% include animation.html file="click-account.gif" %}

Or you can click on the Account Overview icon:

{% include screenshot.html file="reaching-account-overview.png" %}

## Select an Account

If the displayed account is not the one you want to investigate, use the account selector here:

{% include animation.html file="select-account.gif" %}

## Visualize your Account Data

On the screen you will find:

* A total of all upcoming transactions for the coming year.
* A total of all overdue transactions, if any.
* A month-by-month breakdown of upcoming transactions.
* A list of the upcoming transactions for the coming year.
