WiseCash helps you modelize repeat transactions (salaries, subscriptions, etc.) without having to labor over a spreadsheet. Here is how to create a repeat transaction in your forecast:

## Go to the Account Overview page

You can create repeat transactions from most pages in WiseCash, yet doing this from the [Account Overview] page makes it easier to verify your data entry.

## Enter Transaction Information And Create Transaction

Define the type of transaction (expense / income), pick a start date, an account and a repeat period, then click on **Create**:

TODO: screenshot

You can later [modify the amount for one,Modifying One Occurrence of a Series] or [all upcoming transactions,Modifying All Upcoming Occurrences ], or [stop the series,Stopping a Recurring Series]. It's also possible to [simulate month-to-month growth, Simulating Month-to-Month Growth].

TODO: mention that changing date is not yet possible.
