When a recurring series is in place, you may want to stop it.

If this is only temporary, you can **set the amount to zero** and save all upcoming occurrences.

If you want to stop the series for good, though, follow the steps below:

## Go to the Account Overview page

While it can be done from other screens in WiseCash, editing the data from the Account Overview page makes it easier to verify what you are doing.

## Select the first occurrence to be deleted

In the transactions list, click edit on the **first occurrence** that you want to delete.

It should appear in blue and the form should display the corresponding data.

## Click on Delete with future occurrences

You can hover the **Delete with future occurrences** button to get a preview of which transactions will be deleted, then click on the button to validate.
